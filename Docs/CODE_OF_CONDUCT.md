In short: Be nice. No harassment, trolling, or spamming.

- Harassment includes sexual language and imagery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, name-calling, unwelcome attention, libel, and any malicious hacking or social engineering. Our community should be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, national origin, or religion (or lack thereof).
- Trolling includes posting inflammatory comments to provoke an emotional response or disrupt discussions.
- Spamming includes posting off-topic messages to disrupt discussions, promote a product, solicit donations, advertise a job / internship / gig, or flooding discussions with files or text.

If you see someone harass, troll, or spam anywhere in our community (forum, chat, YouTube, etc.), notify us in the  admin chat room – preferably with a screen shot and URL of the offense. The moderator team will take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including banning the offender from Discord.
